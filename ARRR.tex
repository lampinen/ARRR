\section{Reading notes/literature to incorporate(?)}
\subsection{Machine learning}
\begin{itemize}
%% Adversarial
\item Adversarial reprogramming of neural networks -- A cool twist on adversarial examples: the authors were able to "hijack" a variety of networks to perform tasks which were somewhat different from the ones they were trained for by creating an input that consisted of a "program-specifying" perturbation and the data for the new task, and then learning a mapping from the hijacked network's outputs to the new outputs. This is a much stronger (and weirder) kind of transfer than many others, suggesting that the networks are performing deeply non-linear computations and that changes in the inputs can richly explore the space of functions that the networks can compute (i.e. suggesting that the networks are quite chaotic systems). The particular examples they chose share a few more features than I would like (i.e. they are all visual tasks), but nevertheless the results are pretty cool. \cite{Elsayed2018}
\item Adversarial examples that fool both computer vision and time-limited humans -- Shows large-perturbation adversarial examples to humans, and under time-pressure they are more likely to make the same mistakes as the networks. More precisely, the adversarial perturbations systematically reduce performance, whereas a simple change of the adversarial permutation (flipping it vertically) leaves performance mostly unaltered. Furthermore, if they are given a 2AFC where the true class is \textbf{not present} they are systematically biased toward the adversarially targeted class. Under no time pressure, humans accurately classify the images.
%% Transfer 
\item Label efficient learning of transferable representations across domains and tasks -- Throws together a bunch of tricks for the goal of doing transfer learning with a small amount of data, but the key one is using an adversarial discriminator across the hidden layers of the networks performing the different tasks. Aligning the representations in this way appears to substantially improve transfer. (It's probably crucial here that the transfer network is initialized with the parameters of the source network.) \cite{Luo2017} 
\item An overview of multi-task learning in deep neural networks -- 2017 review of the multi-task learning literature in both simpler machine learning models like SVMs and in deep nets, arguing that soft parameter sharing methods of various kinds are underused compared to ``hard'' parameter sharing as with multi-head outputs, e.g.\cite{Ruder2017} 
\item Identifying beneficial task relations for multi-task learning in deep neural networks -- For 10 NLP tasks, this paper trains both single task models and all task pairings, and then exams the extent of transfer for them, and its predictability. They make the claim that ``multi-task gains are more likely for target tasks that quickly plateua with non-plateauing auxiliary tasks,'' with the suggestion that this helps them keep from getting stuck in local minima (saddle-points?). Obviously the complexity of the target task (here number of labels) is also relevant, but also the entropy of the labels in the auxiliary task is positively associated with transfer, i.e. more uniform auxiliary tasks are more likely to yield transfer (less biasing? just more information?). They say something suggestive about being surprised thatt Jensen-Shannon divergences were not particularly predictive features, but they computed them not between tasks as I would have expected but within-task between word train and val frequency distributions.  \cite{Bingel2017}
\item When is multitask learning effective? Semantic sequence prediction under varying data conditions -- Tries frequency and morpho-syntactic auxiliary tasks for semantic NLP tasks, finds that benefits come mostly from auxiliary tasks with \emph{high entropy} and \emph{low skewness}, and that most main tasks don't benefit much (because semantics and syntax are sufficiently separable?). Note that the tasks that do benefit are often the most complex ones and/or ones like question answering where syntax could be highly relevant. \cite{Alonso2017} 
%% RL
\item A deep hierarchical approach to lifelong learning in minecraft -- Does mostly obvious tricks to incorporate options (in the RL sense) into DQN-style learning -- learns options as (possibly distilled) indepndent subnetworks, learns a policy for choosing whether to use a primitive action or an option, and then follows options until a (learned) termination criterion. For all that fancy architecture, it still doesn't have either the flexibility to compose skills or learn more than a fixed number of skills, and the results are far from astonishing. \cite{Tessler2016}.
\item RL$^2$: Fast reinforcement learning via slow reinforcement learning -- The standard deep-learning meta-learning tricks applied to RL. Instead of running an RL algorithm on a single task, train an RL algorithm such that it does well at choosing the next action on *any* given MDP from the sequence of previous states it has seen in that MDP, much as a human might learn to perform quite well on a videogame based on their previous experiences in it. The network does this in the most obvious way: just slap some recurrence in your policy network which maps from (S, A, R, S) tuples to actions and let gradient descent sort the rest out. Works pretty well on some toy non-toy tasks (relatively simple tasks dressed up with high-dimensional input and action spaces).
\item Learning to reinforcement learn -- Much like the RL$^2$ paper above, slaps some recurrence in a network which maps from (S, A, R) tuples to policy and value estimates, and then trains it to do well across episodes drawn from a distribution of tasks, then shows that it generalizes and can even show ``model-like'' behavior, in the sense that it will one-shot learn to take actions which lead to more rewarding states, that is, it seems to have learned to integrate observed transitions and rewards into its decisions on the fly. 
\item Guided cost learning: deep inverse optimal control via policy optimization -- One type of efficient learning that humans can do is learning from demonstrations. The problem of inferring an objective function from a demonstration is know as the inverse RL problem in the RL literature. This paper presents an algorithm for this based on inferring the objective and policy at the same time (instantiating at least the objective as a deep net) and demonstrates the success of the algorithm in robotics. \citep{Finn2016}
%% NLP or "symbolic" architectures
\item Relational inductive biases, deep learning, and graph networks -- Argues that we should build networks that have graph-structured inductive biases about the world, given that the world has relational structure and (insert Gentner here) says it's super important for our reasoning. They propose a general type of networks like this which update as follows: each edge is updated depending on its state, its endpoints states, and the graph state;, each vertex is updated depending on its state, its edges' states, and the graph state; and finally the graph state is updated depending on its state and all its vertices' states. Relates this to an number of other graph/set networks that have been proposed recently. They suggest composing these graph-network blocks much like one would compose layers in a standard neural net, including the possibility of things like recurrence. (However, the constraint of ``things must be the same size'' to be combined in a standard net scales to the much more limiting constraint of ``things must be the same graph'' in this architecture -- this may not be devastating, but isn't there a better way?) They argue that networks built on these principles, because they reuse computations in a way that respects graph structures, will generalize more robustly to new situations. They cite a number of papers that prove this in the case of generalizing to e.g. larger graphs (``combinatorial generalization''). However, they point out that their invariance to node permutations makes certain kind of graph computations difficult, and furthermore that graphs do not make ideas like recursion easy to represent. Furthermore, the type of combinatorial generalization they show is still far from the flexibility of human intelligence.\cite{Battaglia2018} 
\item DARTS: Differentiable Architecture Search -- It's not actually full architecture search that is differentiable, but more searching for blocks (like Inception blocks). The basic idea is very simple: just use a softmax over all possible operations (e.g. conv, pooling, etc.). This is then differentiable, but they are being tricky and optimizing the architecture with respect to the validation loss after a single step of gradient descent on the weights using the train data. Because of this, they find that first order optimization of the architecture alone is insuffficient, so they approximate the second derivative with a finite difference weighted by a tunable parameter, and it works well enough for their purposes. An interesting step towards differentiable architecture search, and they show it speeds up learning certain kinds of cells quite a bit, but the title oversells it a bit I think.  
\item Tensor Product Generation Networks for Deep NLP Modelling -- Implements a NLP architecture that allows for (but does not necessitate) tensor-product-representation-like ``unbinding'' of fillers from roles, achieves state of the art on MSCOCO captioning with it, and then shows that the unbinding vectors are actually fulfilling at least some grammatical functions (although there is probably more mixed in there, and they certainly don't show that they're handling all the grammatical functions, just that they mostly cluster nicely by certain grammatical features).
\item Symbolic functions from neural computation -- Starts from the basic ideas of tensor product representations and symbols as encoded as patterns of activation in an (infinite-dimensional) vector space, and shows some surprisingly complex computations, such as recursive access to node information or children in binary trees, or various grammatical rules, can be reduced to \emph{linear} transformations within these vector spaces.  
\item Optimization and quantization in gradient symbol systems: a framework for integrating the continuous and discrete in cognition -- Essentially a more readable follow-up to \cite{Smolensky2006} above, which goes on to argue that the way to have discrete output attractors from a continuous system is to have essentially seperate \emph{optimization} (continuous, via SGD) and \emph{quantization} (soft discretization), and linearly interpolate from the former to the latter over processing time. Argues that this makes good quantitative predictions about speed accuracy tradeoffs, e.g. \cite{Smolensky2014}
\item Learning and analyzing vector encoding of symbolic representations -- A short paper reviewing some methods of symbol binding in neural nets and proposing to just throw LSTMs at the problem instead, and then showing a very weak demonstration that it works (the embedding vectors kinda obey the basic superposition rule you would want them to). \cite{Fernandez2018} 
\item Improved semantic representations from tree-structured long short-term memory networks -- Points out that there's no reason for the simple chain-style graphs of typical recurrent networks, any DAG will do. In particular, they build tree-structured networks on the fly from various parse trees (constituency and dependency) of sentences, and show that processing the inputs through these networks yields better performance than basic LSTMs on a sentiment and semantic tasks. \cite{Tai2015} 
\item Ask me anything: dynamic memory networks for natural language processing -- Proposes a fairly complicated memory based architecture for NLP tasks like bAbI. Basically, the model consists of a probe encoder, the probe embedding is then used as attention over the input to generate ``episodic'' encodings of each input chunk (sentence or word depending on the task) of the input. Then the memory network does a fixed number of passes of episodic ``recall'' conditioned on 1) the question, and 2) the previously recalled memory, via a GRU with (atypical) attention based on the episode, the previous memory, and the question. The final memory produced is passed as input to the answer module, along with the question. This architecture slightly outperforms simpler architectures at most tasks (including the paper above at sentiment analysis). \cite{Kumar2015}
%% Other
\item On the importance of single directions for generalization -- Ablation/noise robustness of neural networks is related to generalization, networks that memorize more use more ``single directions'' of representation space to encode dimensions. They find that dropout only increases ablation robustness up to the dropout threshold, whereas batch norm substantially increases it. They also find, interestingly, that batch norm substantially decreases class selectivity of any given filter in a CNN, which they suggest explains the previous result. The overall single directions result seems easily explained from Surya's and my generalization theory paper. \cite{Morcos2018}
\item Outrageously large neural networks: the sparsely gated mixture-of-experts layer -- proposes a neural net ``layer'' that consists of many smaller ``expert'' networks (single hidden layer in their examples) that are sparsely selected via importance weights from a top-$k$ selection over a (noisy) softmax based on a learnable linear transform of the input. The model loss includes a term for the coefficient of variation of the importance weights, encouraging many experts to be used (otherwise there is a rich-get-richer problem where the most selected experts become selected even more). Stacking this layer in between LSTMs improves performance on language modeling and translation tasks. \cite{Shazeer2017} 
\item Deep visual-semantic alignments for generating image descriptions -- A paper on image captioning that was one of the first to propose the idea of conditioning RNNs on CNN reps to caption images, and also contains some interesting hints of consistency-based auxiliary tasks based on aligning saliency selected sub-regions of an image (selected for containing objects) with subsets of the caption. \cite{Karpathy2017} 

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cognitive Science}
\begin{itemize}
\item Analogy and abstraction -- A review of analogical reasoning in learning, with a slightly devo focus, exploring phenomena such as superficial similarity driving alignment of domains, how this impacts transfer and when people are able to make more abstract alignments. My (heavily biased) spin on their conclusions is that there is a progression from relations per se to relations-as-objects (cf. Annette Karmilov-Smith) and the claim is that then more abstract relations-among-relations are really just relations among objects which are results of the previous process. \citep{Gentner2017}
\item Similarity and the development of rules -- A review of some of the analogical reasoning literature arguing that similarity (even superficial similarity) is important in abstract reasoning, for example children can learn an abstract relationship more easily if they see superficially similar examples of it first to scaffold it, and the patterns of interference in analogicial reasoning are strongly suggestive of similarity at various levels of abstraction playing a role in reasoning, for both adults and children.
\item A model of learning by incremental analogical reasoning and debugging -- Argues for a process of as-needed structure mapping by directly choosing known structures and doing a top-down matching process that is sensitive to the structural links. It then locally debugs to ``fix'' over-interpretation of the analogy. \cite{Burnstein1983}
\item Learning overhypotheses with hierarchical Bayesian models -- Makes the point that hierarchical Bayesian models can capture learning at different levels of abstraction, acknowledges that the highest level prior must still be built in, but makes the tendentious claim that it can be made simple enough to either be obvious or innate. \citep{Kemp2007}
\item A taxonomy for far transfer -- A review that breaks down transfer studies along axes of content and context (with sub-axes for each) and argues that the disagreement in the literature over whether and to what extent transfer occurs is due to the conflation of these many different types of transfer. Their take, while critical, is generally positive on the existence of far transfer. \citep{Barnett2002}
\item All other things being equal: acquisition and transfer of the control of variables strategy -- Explores teaching the control of variables strategy (i.e. holding everything else constant when testing the effect of one variable) to elementary school children, and seeing how well they're able to apply it and transfer it to new problems (the problems were learning about springs, ramps, and sinking in water). In general, older students did better at both applying and transferring, and students who received explicit instruction as well as probe questions (which made them think about the revelant ideas) did better than students who received only probe questions or nothing. The strategy was transferable to problems that were in some ways superficially different (experimenting on different objects), but where the overall context was similar. Many students in all conditions used (and often mentioned) the strategy at least once. However, relatively few students in any condition were able to explicitly identify the strategy when asked about similarities between the problems. \cite{Chen1999}
\item Statistical learning:  from acquiring specific items to forming general rules. -- Short review arguing that rule-like learning in both adults and children is just statistical learning over appropriate features given the input variability. 
\item Generalization, similarity, and Bayesian Inference -- Bayesian models of category formation and generalization can capture aspects of these phenomena that classical models of Shepherd and others cannot; Priors which assume active sampling of positive examples yield effects like narrowing of CIs (cognitively) around observed exemplars as N increases. \citep{Tenenbaum2001}
\item Two modes of transfer in artificial grammar learning -- Different types of transition features seem to be learned by different processes, or at least processes which are dissociable in terms of how noise affects transfer to novel domains. In particular, repetition is a feature that lends itself to creating abstract ``analogy''-like features which can transfer despite noise (where the transition doesn't always occur even if the first item does), but longer distance pairwise dependencies are very sensitive to noise in co-occurence probabilities. \cite{Tunney2001}
\item Getting symbols out of a neural architecture -- Explores the problem of role-filler binding in neural nets, and argues from basic computational principles that vector addition is the right approach (i.e. have a ``role'' vector and a ``filler'' vector and add them), rather than fancier approaches like outer products, because addition has the right compositional structure for human flexibility. \citet{HummelSomeYear}
\item On the proper treatment of connectionism -- BBS article by Smolensky from the early days of connectionism, articulating a position on the relationship between symbolic and sub-symbolic computation and arguing that emergence is an important and useful way of cognitve function even in highly symbolic domains. Takes a somewhat too discrete dual-systems-like view for my taste, but a good source for old quotes about the relationships between symbols and intuitions in cognition and neural networks. \cite{Smolensky1988}
\item The cognizer's innards: a psychological and philosophical perspective on the development of thought -- Argues for Karmiloff-Smith's \emph{representational redescription} (RR) theory; that we successively create more abstract representations by re-representing our prior knowledge. Points out that connectionist networks typically lack the ability to reason flexibly over their own representations, and suggests that overcoming this may require hybrid models, but points out that they will probably need to be more general than the simple one-level hybrid models that include just one mapping from distributed representations to symbols. Some interesting examples of where to look for evidence of redescription in progress. \cite{Clark1993}

\section{Transfer}
It has been frequently noted that human learning is efficient, \citep[e.g.]{Gentner2003}, and in particular that it is much more data-efficient and flexible than current deep learning systems \citep{Lake2016}. Why might this be? \par
One possible answer is to say that there are architectural and algorithmic differences between humans and neural networks, so deep learning is simply not a good model of human learning. However, there are also a number of differences between the \emph{situations} in which we evaluate human learning and deep learning. One potentially crucial difference is that humans come to tasks with a vast amount of prior experience. Often this prior experience is related in some way to the new tasks we are learning, both through generic structures like language and more specific ones like mathematical or game-playing expertise \citep{Hansen2017}. Thus, humans rarely learn a task from a ``blank slate.'' \par
This is important from the perspective of transfer as ``preparation for future learning'' \citep{Bransford1999}. This perspective suggests that we should think about not just how transfer impacts immediate performance on a new task, but how it impacts the ability to \emph{learn} that task. It is possible that the effects of relevant prior experience will not be apparent immediately on introduction to a new domain, but instead will emerge as the subject comes to understand (either implicitly or explicitly) how that prior knowledge is relevant. \par 
Unfortunately, much of the cognitive work on transfer has ignored this perspective \citep{Bransford1999}. This may have resulted in some of the negative claims about transfer, for example the following quote from \citet{Detterman1993}: 
\begin{quote}
``Significant transfer is probably rare and accounts for very little human behavior. Studies that claim transfer often tell subjects to transfer, or use a `trick' to call the subjects' attention to the similarity of the two problems. Such studies cannot be taken as evidence for transfer. We generally do what we have learned to do and no more.''
\end{quote}
The studies that have demonstrated transfer without using the ``tricks'' that Detterman refers to have generally demonstrated it with quite simple tasks such as grammaticality judgements in toy artificial grammars \citep[e.g.]{Tunney2001} or learning of a simple property of a simple physical system \citep{Day2011}. However, humans learn extremely complicated systems of knowledge that share structure with one another. For example, category theory lays out deep analogies between whole fields of mathematics, which nevertheless could be (and were/are) studied independently. Thus, my first goal for my dissertation is to explore the effects of transfer on learning in tasks which are somewhat closer to the complexity of the tasks that humans actually learn. \par
\section{Different types of knowledge}
Another aspect of human learning is that we often learn many different related tasks within the same domain, either at the same time or sequentially. For example, memorizing multiplication tables and studying number theory are two tasks which in some sense deal with the same domain (integers), but which differ in many ways. How does knowledge interact across these tasks? \par
This can be viewed as a type of transfer which is both nearer (in some superficial details) and yet farther (the tasks are very much non-isomorphic, even if some underlying structure is shared\footnote{The problem of how to quantify to what extent two tasks have shared structure is salient but actually quite difficult. For example, consider the functions \(f: \Ints^2 \rightarrow \Ints^2\) and \(g: \Reals \rightarrow \Reals\) such that \(f((x,y)) = (y, x)\) and \(g(z) = 1/z\). These two functions may seem quite different, they have different domains and ranges, etc. However, if you interpret \((x,y) \in \Ints^2\) as \(x/y \in \Rats\), then it becomes clear that these are actually the same abstract function of multiplicative inversion. The relationship between these functions can be expressed by a commutative diagram, but this requires identifying the mappings between the domains and ranges, which could be quite difficult \emph{a priori}.\par
For an even more difficult example, consider the tasks of a) playing chess, and b) identifying pinned pieces on a chess board. While these tasks clearly share some structure, there is no hope that one of them factors through the other -- at best one might serve as a tiny piece of a factorization of the other (i.e. as a useful but not sufficient feature extractor). How can we decide that two functions are related, and how can we mathematically express this relationship?}) than the type of transfer tasks discussed in the previous section. How does this impact learning? Furthermore, how is this impacted by isomorphic tasks from other domains -- does learning about one category (e.g. sets) make one's reasoning more abstract when learning about another category (e.g. groups)? \par 
A final over-arching type of knowledge we can possess is explicit awareness of a relationship between two tasks. In previous work \citep{Lampinen2017a}, I used neural network simulations to suggest that when performing two analogous tasks, the analogies will naturally be reflected in the representations formed. Thus representational similarities could be used as a heuristic when searching for an explicit analogy. \par
My second goal for my dissertation is to understand how different types of knowledge interact. Ideally, I would like to explore both within domain interactions of different types of knowledge, how within-domain knowledge is impacted by transfer across domains, and how explicit knowledge about relationships across domains emerges. \par

\label{results}
\end{figure}
I have run a preliminary experiment in that captures many of these issues; in this section I briefly describe this experiment and a few results. \par
The experiment consists of two superficially dissimilar tasks that participants perform across multiple experimental sessions. Abstractly, both tasks consist of learning to navigate around a directed graph using two different actions which correspond to two different edge types; see Fig. \ref{hexagon_diagrams} for the structures we used. The crucial experimental manipulation is whether the graph structures are the same or different in the two tasks. \par
The superficially-different cover stories we used for these tasks were 1) learning to navigate around a house by going through one of two doors in the rooms of the house, and 2) mutating fractals into one another by using one of two mutagens (see Fig. \ref{tasks}). \par 
We evaluated the number of steps it took participants to solve fractal task trials if they had an isomorphic door task vs. a non-isomorphic one, and found that they took significantly fewer steps if the tasks were isomorphic, see Fig. \ref{results_ns}. Furthermore, having an isomorphic task seemed to potentially increase subjects within-task knowledge, for example increasing the probablility that they could correctly identify the graph structure that their fractal task was based upon, see Fig. \ref{results_ds}. Furthermore, participants in the isomorphic condition were above chance at identifying the mapping between the two tasks. Intriguigingly, explicit realization of the analogy between the tasks did not seem to be sufficient or necessary for the transfer results, although they seemed to be somewhat positively correlated.\par
Overall, isomorphisms between the tasks appear to have effects, but there is a superficial aspect of the graph structures which could explain most of the results we saw here (I will explain further in the meeting). We are about to run a follow-up experiment that should address this concern, as well as a few others; I will describe the changes in more detail during the meeting. 
\section{What's next}
First, I need to review the literature on cognitive transfer and abstraction and multi-task learning more thoroughly, in order to understand better the present state of thinking in the field. Second, there is much more experimental work to be done. We need to verify these results and explore their robustness to changes of graph structure, cover task, etc. I'd also like to explore whether the knowledge transfer is occurring implicitly or explicitly or whether it is different for individual subjects, and whether different degrees of explicitness result in different patterns of transfer. Finally, I'd like to try to model both the procedural transfer of knowledge between tasks and the relationship between procedural and explicit knowledge. \par
